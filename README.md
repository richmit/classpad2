# A Collection of eActivities & Programs for the Casio Classpad II

This repo contains four directories:

 - mjrLib: Tons of random functions
   - CAS helpers
   - Physical Constants
   - Bit Manipulation
   - Linear Algebra
   - Polynomial Stuff
   - Repeated Measurement with Uncertainty
   - Trig Functions
   - Units Conversions
 - mjrProg: A few programs
 - mjrComp: Computational eActivities -- eActivities I saved off because they contain a general computational pattern I can reuse.
 - mjrEqn: Equations
 - docs: [Documentation](https://richmit.github.io/classpad2/) (rendered `org-mode` files).

The documentation is also published here: [Docs](https://richmit.github.io/classpad2/)

Have fun!
